  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to
              help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the
              results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds
              functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are
              statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the
              number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in
              the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the
              increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many
              current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.
              PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in
              the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed ``Enrichment
              Map'', a network-based visualization method for gene-set
              enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where
              each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets.
              Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network
              clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major
              enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the
              enrichment results. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment Map is a significant
              advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any
              research project that generates a list of genes can take
              advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is
              implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for
              the Cytoscape network visualization software
              (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).",

              arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays,
              microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability
              to integrate information across platforms provided key insights
              into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated
              the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining
              data from five platforms, each of which shows significant
              molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes
              (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10\% incidence across all
              breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated
              and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific
              mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype.
              We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups,
              possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and
              integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways
              dominant in each molecular subtype including a
              HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature
              within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of
              basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours
              showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related
              aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological
              finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by
              different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises
              the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity
              and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major
              biological subtypes of breast cancer.",

              powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

              regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several
              cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer.
              Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity
              between two independent studies of patient survival in lung
              cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA

  abstract = "Networks often contain regions of tightly connected nodes, or
              clusters, that highlight their shared relationships. An effective
              way to create a visual summary of a network is to identify
              clusters and annotate them with an enclosing shape and a
              summarizing label. Cytoscape provides the ability to annotate a
              network with shapes and labels, however these annotations must be
              created manually one at a time, which can be a laborious process.
              AutoAnnotate is a Cytoscape 3 App that automates the process of
              identifying clusters and visually annotating them. It greatly
              reduces the time and effort required to fully annotate clusters

              strategies for identifying and labelling clusters. Many

              refine the generated annotations as required. Annotated clusters
              may be collapsed into single nodes using the Cytoscape groups
              feature, which helps simplify a network by making its overall
              structure more visible. AutoAnnotate is applicable to any type of

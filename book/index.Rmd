# Multi-modal Data Integration ( June 2021 )

This book contains lab exercises for Module 10: Multi-modal Data Integration, as part of the [Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop Cancer (CAN) Module](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2021-cancer-analysis/).

You can download course slides here (ADD LINK)

We will have two lab exercises learning to build patient classifiers using multi-modal data integration:

**LAB 1: Gentle introduction:** We will build a **three-way classifier** of tumour subtype using four types of -omic data (gene expression, miRNA, DNA methylation and proteomics). Simple design with a single patient similarity network created from each layer, using Pearson correlation-based similarity.

```{r,eval=TRUE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Lab1_design.jpg")
```

**LAB 2: Pathway features:** We will build a **binary classifier** of tumour subtype using gene expression and clinical data. We will define features at the pathway level for gene expression to identify pathways predictive of outcome, and features using individual clinical variables. For the latter we will tell netDx to use a custom similarity metric of normalized difference.

```{r,eval=TRUE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Lab2_design.jpg")
```

We're going to use **Rstudio** to run these labs.

Let's go!

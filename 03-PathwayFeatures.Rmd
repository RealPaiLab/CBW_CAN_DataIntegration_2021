# Lab 2: Pathway-level features

In this example, we will learn how to:

* Use custom similarity metrics
* Group variables into biologically-meaningful units such as pathways, for improved interpretability

Here, we will again use breast cancer samples, and discriminate between Luminal A, Luminal B and basal-like tumours. We will limit ourselves to clinical data and gene expression data but will make the following design changes:

![](images/Lab2_design.jpg)

 * Clinical variables: A feature (or patient similarity network;PSN) will be defined at the level of selected  *variables* (e.g. age); we will define similarity as *normalized difference*. 
 * Gene expression: Features will be defined at the level of ***pathways***; i.e. each feature groups only those genes corresponding to the pathway. Similarity is defined as pairwise *Pearson correlation*.
 
## Setup

Let's fetch the BRCA data using `curatedTCGAData` again, this time only the gene expression data. Remember, the clinical data we automatically get in the `colData()` slot returned.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(curatedTCGAData))
brca <- suppressMessages(
   curatedTCGAData(
	   "BRCA",c("mRNAArray"),
	   dry.run=FALSE)
	)
```

As before, we prepare the data:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
source("prepare_data.R")
brca <- prepareDataForCBW(brca)
```

## Rules to create features (patient similarity networks)

Load the `netDx` package and initialize the `groupList` object, which where we will store our grouping rules.
Recall that this is a list-of-lists, with the top tier containing data layer names, and that the layer names must match `names(assays(brca))` or whatever your `MultiAssayExperiment` object is called.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(require(netDx)))
groupList <- list()
```

### RNA: Pathway features

Let's group genes into *pathway-level features*, i.e. instead of one PSN for transcriptomic data, we create one PSN for each *pathway*, using transcriptomic data. So if you had a pathway set with 2,000 curated pathways, this would generate 2,000 input PSN. 

NOTE: This mode changes model-building time to several hours, so avoid large gene sets (e.g. the full set of ~44,000 Gene Ontology terms, or even ~29,000 GO Biological Process terms). This list can be pruned by constraining the min/max number of genes in a set, but is something to keep in mind.

There are two ways of providing pathway data to netDx:
1. You can **download** a compilation of pathways from curated databases using the `fetchPathwayDefinitions()` function in netDx, like so:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
x <- fetchPathwayDefinitions("March",2021)
x
```

The above pathway file was downloaded from [download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets](http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets), which is a good resource for routinely-updated curated pathway definitions. Pathways are compiled from Reactome, Panther, NCI, MSigDB, etc., [REF], and data is contained in GMT format, a common format to represent gene-sets, such as pathways. You can see from the value of `x` that the file isn't downloaded to our working directory, but rather is stored in a BioConductor-specific location for files (file cache), using the BiocFileCache class. This way if we rerun the script, BioConductor will only download the file again if it has changed since our last download.

We can now look at the first three pathways in the file to get a sense of the GMT format:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
###system2("head",args=c("-n","3", x))
```

We then use `readPathways()` to read the pathways into a list format to provide the predictor with:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
pathList <- readPathways(fetchPathwayDefinitions("March",2021))
head(pathList)
```

2. Alternatively, you can also provide a custom pathway set to netDx by reading in a GMT file, using the `readPathways()` function. In this example, I've downloaded a geneset of [pathways often dysregulated in cancer](http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp#C7), set C6 from MSigDB (REF):

```{r,eval=FALSE}
#####TBA
###myGMTfile <- "supporting_files/c6.all.c7.4.symbols.gmt"
###file.exists(myGMTfile)
####x <- readPathways(myGMTfile)
###head(x)
```

For this tutorial we will limit ourselves to the first set of pathways and use `groupList` to tell netDx to group transcriptomic data using pathways. 

**NOTE: The pathway definition file should use the same identifier type as your patient data. For instance, if the genes in your transcriptomic data are represented using HGNC symbols, then your pathway definition file must also use HGNC symbols (e.g. *ID2S*), and not a different type of identifier, such as Ensembl IDs (which look like this: *ENSG00000010404*).**


```{r,eval=FALSE}
groupList[["BRCA_mRNAArray-20160128"]] <- pathList 
```

## Clinical data: Single variable features
Models often include clinical variables such as demographic or disease-related features such as age, sex, or treatment regimen. In this example, we take two variables from the sample metadata, and include create one PSN *for each variable*.  

So here, we map the following:

* `patient.age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis` to `age` (just shorter)
* `stage` to `STAGE`

These variables must be present in the `colData()` slot:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
pheno <- colData(brca)
head(pheno[,c("patient.age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis","STAGE")])
```

We now add the entry into `groupList`. The entry for `clinical` is special because netDx will look for corresponding variables in the sample metadata table, `colData()`, rather than looking for "clinical"  within `assays(brca)`.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
groupList[["clinical"]] <- list(
      age="patient.age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis",
	   stage="STAGE"
)
```

## Rules to create PSNs
We now tell netDx what similarity metric to use 

This is `makeNets()` just as we had seen in the previous exercise, which provides `netDx` with a custom function to generate similarity networks (i.e. features). We previously used the following code to create PSN based on Pearson correlation: 

*(Do not paste this in)*
```{r,eval=FALSE}
makePSN_NamedMatrix(..., writeProfiles=TRUE,...)`
```
We will now make a different call to `makePSN_NamedMatrix()` but this time, requesting the use of the normalized difference similarity metric. 

This is achieved by calling the following code *(Do not paste this in, either)*:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
   makePSN_NamedMatrix(,..., 
                       simMetric="custom", customFunc=normDiff,
                       writeProfiles=FALSE)
```

`normDiff` is a function provided in the `netDx` package, but the user may define custom similarity functions in this block of code and pass those to `makePSN_NamedMatrix()`, using the `customFunc` parameters; additionally set `simMetric` to `custom`.

Other presets provided by netDx include: 

* `sim.pearscale`: Pearson correlation followed by exponential scaling; used with a vector
* `sim.eucscale`: Euclidean disance followed by exponential scaling; used with a vector
* `normDiff`: Normalized difference; used with a single variable such as age
* `avgNormDiff`: Average normalized difference; used with a vector

When we're done, this is what the `makeNets` function look like. I realize this may be complicated and future versions of netDx will simplify this syntax.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
makeNets <- function(dataList, groupList, netDir,...) {
	netList <- c() 

	# for all layers except clinical data (here, mRNA data)
	# use Pearson correlation
	for (nm in setdiff(names(groupList),"clinical")) {
		if (!is.null(groupList[[nm]])) { ## REMEMBER TO CHECK FOR NULL
		netList <- makePSN_NamedMatrix(
			dataList[[nm]],
			rownames(dataList[[nm]]),
			groupList[[nm]],
			netDir,
			verbose=FALSE,
			writeProfiles=TRUE,			## define Pearson similarity as before
			...) 
		}
	}
	
	# make clinical nets (normalized difference)
	netList2 <- c()
	if (!is.null(groupList[["clinical"]])) {
	netList2 <- makePSN_NamedMatrix(
		dataList$clinical, 
		rownames(dataList$clinical),
		groupList[["clinical"]],netDir,
		simMetric="custom",customFunc=normDiff, ### Notice simMetric & customFunc
		writeProfiles=FALSE,
		sparsify=TRUE,
		verbose=FALSE,
		...)
	}
	netList <- c(unlist(netList),unlist(netList2))
	return(netList)
}

```

## Build predictor

Finally!
We have:

* prepared our data,
* grouped RNA by pathways (`fetchPathwayDefinitions()`, `readPathways()`),
* created two PSN using clinical variables (`groupList$clinical`), and
* defined our similarity metrics (`makeNets()`).

Now we build our predictors. We use two train/test splits, score feature selection out of 2. For each split, selected features are those that score 1+ out of 2 or more.

**Realistic parameters:** Reasonable values are  `numSplits=100L` (10 is a good start, just to see if you get signal), `featScoreMax=10L`, `featScoreMax=9L`.
 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
set.seed(42) # make results reproducible
outDir <- paste(tempdir(),"pred_output",sep=getFileSep()) # use absolute path
numSplits <- 2L
model <- suppressMessages(
   buildPredictor(
	   dataList=brca,
	   groupList=groupList,
	   makeNetFunc=makeNets,
	   outDir=outDir, 
	   numSplits=numSplits, 
	   featScoreMax=2L, 
	   featSelCutoff=1L,
	   numCores=4L
	   )
)
```

Let's actually load data generated by reasonable parameters, e.g. `numSplits=10L`, `featScoreMax=10L`, `featSelCutoff=9L`, generated for this tutorial:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
outFile <- sprintf("%s/CBW_Lab2_full.rda",tempdir())
download.file("https://github.com/RealPaiLab/CBW_CAN_DataIntegration_2021/raw/master/data_files/brca_pathways_full.rda", outFile)
lnames <- load(outFile)
```
We can see the objects in the file using `lnames()`. 

## Examine output
As before, we get model results, using `getResults()` from our helper script, `helper.R`. We define sel

```{r,eval=FALSE}
source("helper.R")
results <- getResults(brca,model_full,
	featureSelCutoff=9L,
	featureSelPct=0.9)
```

Let's examine our confusion matrix:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
confusionMatrix(model_full)
```

## View top-scoring pathways with EnrichmentMap
We will now visualize top-scoring pathways using EnrichmentMap.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
###plotEmap(gmtFiles[[1]],nodeAttrFiles[[1]],
###         groupClusters=TRUE, hideNodeLabels=TRUE)
```


## sessionInfo
```{r,eval=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

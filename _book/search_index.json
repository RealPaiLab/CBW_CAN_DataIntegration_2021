For this we will use data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas, and will integrate four types of -omic data: gene expression (measured on XXX arrays) DNA methylation (XXX arrays) proteomic measures from XXX, and miRNA sequencing Prepare data In this example, we use curated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, through the BioConductor curatedTCGAData package.

This includes: removing duplicate samples reformatting patient IDs (e.g. removing spaces and hyphens) creating an ID column in colData(brca), which contains unique patient IDs creating a STATUS column in colData(brca) which contains the patient labels (i.e what we want netDx to classify). In practice you would do this once and save the data before running netDx. This code has been moved into a supporting file, prepare_data.R. You can explore it after the lab to see how some things are achieved (e.g. removing duplicate samples). source(&quot;prepare_data.R&quot;) brca &lt;- prepareDataForCBW(brca) ## harmonizing input: ## removing 42 sampleMap rows with &#39;colname&#39; not in colnames of experiments ## harmonizing input: ## removing 59 sampleMap rows with &#39;colname&#39; not in colnames of experiments ## harmonizing input: ## removing 19 sampleMap rows with &#39;colname&#39; not in colnames of experiments ## harmonizing input: ## removing 26 sampleMap rows with &#39;colname&#39; not in colnames of experiments Notice that we now have ID and STATUS columns in the sample metadata table.

This is done specifically by telling the model how to group different types of data and how to define similarity for each of these (e.g. Pearson correlation, normalized difference, etc.,). The relevant input parameters are: dataList: the patient data, provided as a MultiAssayExperiment object. Refer to the tutorials for MultiAssayExperiment to see how to construct those objects from data. groupList: sets of input data that would correspond to individual networks (e.g. genes grouped into pathways) Let’s start by loading the netDx package. suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(require(netDx))) Let’s set up each of the input arguments one by one. dataList What is this: The input data. Format: MultiAssayExperiment object. We’ve already set this up; this is the brca object, so nothing more to do here. groupList What is this: groupList tells netDx how to group measures within a layer, to generate a PSN. Measures could be individual genes, proteins, CpG bases (in DNA methylation data), clinical variables, etc., In this simple example we just create one PSN per datatype: expr &lt;- assays(brca) groupList &lt;- list() for (k in 1:length(expr)) { cur &lt;- expr[[k]]; nm &lt;- names(expr)[k] # all measure names should be in rownames column groupList[[nm]] &lt;- list(nm=rownames(cur)) names(groupList[[nm]])[1] &lt;- nm; } groupList is a two tiered list, or list-of-lists. The first tier is for each data layers, with names matching those in assays(brca). The second tier contains all the PSNs we want to make for that layer. **SP: Here is the first layer: summary(groupList) ## Length Class Mode ## BRCA_miRNASeqGene-20160128 1 -none- list ## BRCA_mRNAArray-20160128 1 -none- list ## BRCA_RPPAArray-20160128 1 -none- list ## BRCA_Methylation_methyl27-20160128 1 -none- list In this lab exercise we create only one PSN per data layer, using all the measures from an -omic assay. e.g. One PSN based on similarity across entire transcriptome, one for methylome, etc.,). So in this lab exercise, the inner tier simply contains one entry, with all measures for the given layer. This design will get more interested in Lab 2, when we create pathway-level features. names(groupList[[&quot;BRCA_mRNAArray-20160128&quot;]]) ## [1] &quot;BRCA_mRNAArray-20160128&quot; head(groupList[[&quot;BRCA_mRNAArray-20160128&quot;]][[1]]) ## [1] &quot;ELMO2&quot; &quot;CREB3L1&quot; &quot;RPS11&quot; &quot;PNMA1&quot; &quot;MMP2&quot; &quot;C10orf90&quot; Define patient similarity for each network This function is defined by the user and tells the predictor how to create networks from the provided input data. This function requires dataList,groupList, and netDir as input variables. The residual ... parameter is to pass additional variables to makePSN_NamedMatrix(), notably numCores (number of parallel jobs). netDx requires that this function have: dataList,groupList, and netDir as input variables. The residual ... parameter is to pass additional variables to makePSN_NamedMatrix(), notably number of cores for parallel processing (numCores). makeNets &lt;- function(dataList, groupList, netDir,...) { netList &lt;- c() # initialize before is.null() check layerNames &lt;- c(&quot;BRCA_miRNASeqGene-20160128&quot;, &quot;BRCA_mRNAArray-20160128&quot;, &quot;BRCA_RPPAArray-20160128&quot;, &quot;BRCA_Methylation_methyl27-20160128&quot;) for (nm in layerNames){ ## for each layer if (!is.null(groupList[[nm]])){ ## must check for null for each layer netList_cur &lt;- makePSN_NamedMatrix( dataList[[nm]], rownames(dataList[[nm]]), ## names of measures (e.g. genes, CpGs) groupList[[nm]], ## how to group measures in that layer netDir, ## leave this as-is, netDx will figure out where this is. verbose=TRUE, writeProfiles=TRUE, ## use Pearson correlation-based similarity ... ) netList &lt;- c(netList,netList_cur) ## just leave this in } } return(unlist(netList)) ## just leave this in } Note: While netDx provides a high degree of flexibility in achieving your design of choice, it is up to the user to ensure that the design, i.e. the similarity metric and variable groupings, is appropriate for your application. Domain knowledge is almost likely required for good design. Build predictor Finally we call the function that runs the netDx predictor. We provide: patient data (dataList) grouping rules (groupList) function to create PSN from data, includes choice of similarity metric (makeNetFunc) number of train/test splits over which to collect feature scores and average performance: numSplits, maximum score for features in one round of feature selection (featScoreMax, set to 10) threshold to call feature-selected networks for each train/test split (featSelCutoff); only features scoring this value or higher will be used to classify test patients, number of cores to use for parallel processing (numCores). The call below runs 2 train/test splits, to be able to run fast. Within each split, it: splits data into train/test using the default split of 80:20 score2 networks between 0 to 2 (i.e. featScoreMax=2) uses networks that score &gt;=1 out of 2 (featSelCutoff) to classify test samples for that split. These are unrealistically low values set so the example will run fast. In practice a good starting point is featScoreMax=10, featSelCutoff=9 and numSplits=100, but these parameters depend on the sample sizes in the dataset and heterogeneity of the samples. set.seed(42) # make results reproducible outDir &lt;- paste(tempdir(),randAlphanumString(), &quot;pred_output&quot;,sep=getFileSep()) ###if (file.exists(outDir)) unlink(outDir,recursive=TRUE) ### ###model &lt;- buildPredictor( ### dataList=brca, ## your data ### groupList=groupList, ## grouping strategy ### makeNetFunc=makeNets, ## function to build PSNs ### outDir=outDir, ## output directory ### trainProp=0.8, ## pct of samples to use to train model in ## each split ### numSplits=2L, ## number of train/test splits ### featSelCutoff=1L, ## threshold for calling something ## feature-selected ### featScoreMax=2L, ## max score for feature selection ### numCores=4L, ## set higher for parallelizing ### debugMode=FALSE, ### keepAllData=FALSE, ## set to TRUE for debugging or low-level files used by the predictor ### logging=&quot;none&quot; ### ) load(&quot;/home/spai/data/CBW2021/model_twosplits.rda&quot;) Examine output The results are stored in the list object returned by the buildPredictor() call. This list contains: inputNets: all input networks that the model started with. Split&lt;i&gt;: a list with results for each train-test split predictions: real and predicted labels for test patients accuracy: percent accuracy of predictions featureScores: feature scores for each label (list with g entries, where g is number of patient labels).

You have successfully classified three types of tumours by integrating four different -omic layers (transcriptomic, methylomic,proteomic and miRNA). But these features aren’t really interpretable. Let’s change that with our next tutorial. Best practices side note: We end this tutorial with a call to sessionInfo() which prints the complete environment information for your R session. This is standard output that should be reported to R package managers when you write in with a question, particularly if reporting an error or bug. Sometimes a particular underlying dependency package may be the cause of an error, or you may need to upgrade to a newer version of the package. By including this info in an email, you will allow the other person to better solve your issue. sessionInfo sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats4 parallel stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] plotrix_3.8-1 ggplot2_3.3.3 Rtsne_0.15 rhdf5_2.34.0 curatedTCGAData_1.12.1 ## [6] MultiAssayExperiment_1.16.0 SummarizedExperiment_1.20.0 GenomicRanges_1.42.0 GenomeInfoDb_1.26.7 IRanges_2.24.1 ## [11] S4Vectors_0.28.1 MatrixGenerics_1.2.1 matrixStats_0.58.0 netDx_1.2.3 bigmemory_4.5.36 ## [16] Biobase_2.50.0 BiocGenerics_0.36.1 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] utf8_1.2.1 R.utils_2.10.1 tidyselect_1.1.1 RSQLite_2.2.7 AnnotationDbi_1.52.0 ## [6] grid_4.0.5 combinat_0.0-8 BiocParallel_1.24.1 RNeXML_2.4.5 munsell_0.5.0 ## [11] codetools_0.2-18 withr_2.4.2 colorspace_2.0-1 highr_0.9 knitr_1.33 ## [16] uuid_0.1-4 zinbwave_1.12.0 rstudioapi_0.13 SingleCellExperiment_1.12.0 ROCR_1.0-11 ## [21] NMF_0.23.0 labeling_0.4.2 GenomeInfoDbData_1.2.4 bit64_4.0.5 farver_2.1.0 ## [26] vctrs_0.3.8 generics_0.1.0 xfun_0.23 BiocFileCache_1.14.0 R6_2.5.0 ## [31] doParallel_1.0.16 ggbeeswarm_0.6.0 netSmooth_1.10.0 rsvd_1.0.5 RJSONIO_1.3-1.4 ## [36] locfit_1.5-9.4 bitops_1.0-7 rhdf5filters_1.2.1 cachem_1.0.5 DelayedArray_0.16.3 ## [41] assertthat_0.2.1 promises_1.2.0.1 scales_1.1.1 beeswarm_0.3.1 gtable_0.3.0 ## [46] phylobase_0.8.10 beachmat_2.6.4 rlang_0.4.11 genefilter_1.72.1 splines_4.0.5 ## [51] lazyeval_0.2.2 BiocManager_1.30.15 yaml_2.2.1 reshape2_1.4.4 httpuv_1.6.1 ## [56] tools_4.0.5 bookdown_0.22 gridBase_0.4-7 ellipsis_0.3.2 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [61] RColorBrewer_1.1-2 Rcpp_1.0.6 plyr_1.8.6 sparseMatrixStats_1.2.1 progress_1.2.2 ## [66] zlibbioc_1.36.0 purrr_0.3.4 RCurl_1.98-1.3 prettyunits_1.1.1 viridis_0.6.1 ## [71] cluster_2.1.1 tinytex_0.31 magrittr_2.0.1 data.table_1.14.0 RSpectra_0.16-0 ## [76] hms_1.1.0 mime_0.10 evaluate_0.14 xtable_1.8-4 XML_3.99-0.6 ## [81] gridExtra_2.3 shape_1.4.6 compiler_4.0.5 scater_1.18.6 tibble_3.1.2 ## [86] RCy3_2.10.2 crayon_1.4.1 R.oo_1.24.0 htmltools_0.5.1.1 entropy_1.3.0 ## [91] later_1.2.0 tidyr_1.1.3 howmany_0.3-1 DBI_1.1.1 ExperimentHub_1.16.1 ## [96] dbplyr_2.1.1 MASS_7.3-53.1 rappdirs_0.3.3 Matrix_1.3-2 ade4_1.7-16 ## [101] R.methodsS3_1.8.1 igraph_1.2.6 pkgconfig_2.0.3 bigmemory.sri_0.1.3 rncl_0.8.4 ## [106] registry_0.5-1 locfdr_1.1-8 scuttle_1.0.4 xml2_1.3.2 foreach_1.5.1 ## [111] annotate_1.68.0 vipor_0.4.5 bslib_0.2.5.1 rngtools_1.5 pkgmaker_0.32.2 ## [116] XVector_0.30.0 stringr_1.4.0 digest_0.6.27 pracma_2.3.3 graph_1.68.0 ## [121] softImpute_1.4-1 rmarkdown_2.8 edgeR_3.32.1 DelayedMatrixStats_1.12.3 curl_4.3.1 ## [126] kernlab_0.9-29 shiny_1.6.0 lifecycle_1.0.0 nlme_3.1-152 jsonlite_1.7.2 ## [131] clusterExperiment_2.10.1 Rhdf5lib_1.12.1 BiocNeighbors_1.8.2 viridisLite_0.4.0 limma_3.46.0 ## [136] fansi_0.4.2 pillar_1.6.1 lattice_0.20-41 fastmap_1.1.0 httr_1.4.2 ## [141] survival_3.2-10 interactiveDisplayBase_1.28.0 glue_1.4.2 iterators_1.0.13 BiocVersion_3.12.0 ## [146] glmnet_4.1-1 bit_4.0.4 stringi_1.6.2 sass_0.4.0 HDF5Array_1.18.1 ## [151] blob_1.2.1 BiocSingular_1.6.0 AnnotationHub_2.22.1 memoise_2.0.0 dplyr_1.0.6 ## [156] irlba_2.3.3 ape_5.5 "],["lab-2-pathway-level-features.html", "Lab 2: Pathway-level features Setup Rules to create features (patient similarity networks) Clinical data: Single variable features Rules to create PSNs Build predictor Examine output View top-scoring pathways with EnrichmentMap sessionInfo", " Lab 2: Pathway-level features In this example, we will learn how to: Use custom similarity metrics Group variables into biologically-meaningful units such as pathways, for improved interpretability Here, we will again use breast cancer samples, and discriminate between Luminal A, Luminal B and basal-like tumours. We will limit ourselves to clinical data and gene expression data but will make the following design changes: Clinical variables: A feature (or patient similarity network;PSN) will be defined at the level of selected variables (e.g. age); we will define similarity as normalized difference. Gene expression: Features will be defined at the level of pathways; i.e. each feature groups only those genes corresponding to the pathway. Similarity is defined as pairwise Pearson correlation. Setup Let’s fetch the BRCA data using curatedTCGAData again, this time only the gene expression data. Remember, the clinical data we automatically get in the colData() slot returned. suppressMessages(library(curatedTCGAData)) brca &lt;- suppressMessages( curatedTCGAData( &quot;BRCA&quot;,c(&quot;mRNAArray&quot;), dry.run=FALSE) ) As before, we prepare the data: source(&quot;prepare_data.R&quot;) brca &lt;- prepareDataForCBW(brca) Rules to create features (patient similarity networks) Load the netDx package and initialize the groupList object, which where we will store our grouping rules. Recall that this is a list-of-lists, with the top tier containing data layer names, and that the layer names must match names(assays(brca)) or whatever your MultiAssayExperiment object is called. suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(require(netDx))) groupList &lt;- list() RNA: Pathway features Let’s group genes into pathway-level features, i.e. instead of one PSN for transcriptomic data, we create one PSN for each pathway, using transcriptomic data. So if you had a pathway set with 2,000 curated pathways, this would generate 2,000 input PSN. NOTE: This mode changes model-building time to several hours, so avoid large gene sets (e.g. the full set of ~44,000 Gene Ontology terms, or even ~29,000 GO Biological Process terms). This list can be pruned by constraining the min/max number of genes in a set, but is something to keep in mind. There are two ways of providing pathway data to netDx: 1. You can download a compilation of pathways from curated databases using the fetchPathwayDefinitions() function in netDx, like so: x &lt;- fetchPathwayDefinitions(&quot;March&quot;,2021) x The above pathway file was downloaded from download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets, which is a good resource for routinely-updated curated pathway definitions. Pathways are compiled from Reactome, Panther, NCI, MSigDB, etc., [REF], and data is contained in GMT format, a common format to represent gene-sets, such as pathways. You can see from the value of x that the file isn’t downloaded to our working directory, but rather is stored in a BioConductor-specific location for files (file cache), using the BiocFileCache class. This way if we rerun the script, BioConductor will only download the file again if it has changed since our last download. We can now look at the first three pathways in the file to get a sense of the GMT format: ###system2(&quot;head&quot;,args=c(&quot;-n&quot;,&quot;3&quot;, x)) We then use readPathways() to read the pathways into a list format to provide the predictor with: pathList &lt;- readPathways(fetchPathwayDefinitions(&quot;March&quot;,2021)) head(pathList) Alternatively, you can also provide a custom pathway set to netDx by reading in a GMT file, using the readPathways() function. In this example, I’ve downloaded a geneset of pathways often dysregulated in cancer, set C6 from MSigDB (REF): #####TBA ###myGMTfile &lt;- &quot;supporting_files/c6.all.c7.4.symbols.gmt&quot; ###file.exists(myGMTfile) ####x &lt;- readPathways(myGMTfile) ###head(x) For this tutorial we will limit ourselves to the first set of pathways and use groupList to tell netDx to group transcriptomic data using pathways. NOTE: The pathway definition file should use the same identifier type as your patient data. For instance, if the genes in your transcriptomic data are represented using HGNC symbols, then your pathway definition file must also use HGNC symbols (e.g. ID2S), and not a different type of identifier, such as Ensembl IDs (which look like this: ENSG00000010404). groupList[[&quot;BRCA_mRNAArray-20160128&quot;]] &lt;- pathList Clinical data: Single variable features Models often include clinical variables such as demographic or disease-related features such as age, sex, or treatment regimen. In this example, we take two variables from the sample metadata, and include create one PSN for each variable. So here, we map the following: patient.age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis to age (just shorter) stage to STAGE These variables must be present in the colData() slot: pheno &lt;- colData(brca) head(pheno[,c(&quot;patient.age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis&quot;,&quot;STAGE&quot;)]) We now add the entry into groupList. The entry for clinical is special because netDx will look for corresponding variables in the sample metadata table, colData(), rather than looking for “clinical” within assays(brca). groupList[[&quot;clinical&quot;]] &lt;- list( age=&quot;patient.age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis&quot;, stage=&quot;STAGE&quot; ) Rules to create PSNs We now tell netDx what similarity metric to use This is makeNets() just as we had seen in the previous exercise, which provides netDx with a custom function to generate similarity networks (i.e. features). We previously used the following code to create PSN based on Pearson correlation: (Do not paste this in) makePSN_NamedMatrix(..., writeProfiles=TRUE,...)` We will now make a different call to makePSN_NamedMatrix() but this time, requesting the use of the normalized difference similarity metric. This is achieved by calling the following code (Do not paste this in, either): makePSN_NamedMatrix(,..., simMetric=&quot;custom&quot;, customFunc=normDiff, writeProfiles=FALSE) normDiff is a function provided in the netDx package, but the user may define custom similarity functions in this block of code and pass those to makePSN_NamedMatrix(), using the customFunc parameters; additionally set simMetric to custom. Other presets provided by netDx include: sim.pearscale: Pearson correlation followed by exponential scaling; used with a vector sim.eucscale: Euclidean disance followed by exponential scaling; used with a vector normDiff: Normalized difference; used with a single variable such as age avgNormDiff: Average normalized difference; used with a vector When we’re done, this is what the makeNets function look like. I realize this may be complicated and future versions of netDx will simplify this syntax. makeNets &lt;- function(dataList, groupList, netDir,...) { netList &lt;- c() # for all layers except clinical data (here, mRNA data) # use Pearson correlation for (nm in setdiff(names(groupList),&quot;clinical&quot;)) { if (!is.null(groupList[[nm]])) { ## REMEMBER TO CHECK FOR NULL netList &lt;- makePSN_NamedMatrix( dataList[[nm]], rownames(dataList[[nm]]), groupList[[nm]], netDir, verbose=FALSE, writeProfiles=TRUE, ## define Pearson similarity as before ...) } } # make clinical nets (normalized difference) netList2 &lt;- c() if (!is.null(groupList[[&quot;clinical&quot;]])) { netList2 &lt;- makePSN_NamedMatrix( dataList$clinical, rownames(dataList$clinical), groupList[[&quot;clinical&quot;]],netDir, simMetric=&quot;custom&quot;,customFunc=normDiff, ### Notice simMetric &amp; customFunc writeProfiles=FALSE, sparsify=TRUE, verbose=FALSE, ...) } netList &lt;- c(unlist(netList),unlist(netList2)) return(netList) } Build predictor Finally! We have: prepared our data, grouped RNA by pathways (fetchPathwayDefinitions(), readPathways()), created two PSN using clinical variables (groupList$clinical), and defined our similarity metrics (makeNets()). Now we build our predictors. We use two train/test splits, score feature selection out of 2. For each split, selected features are those that score 1+ out of 2 or more. Realistic parameters: Reasonable values are numSplits=100L (10 is a good start, just to see if you get signal), featScoreMax=10L, featScoreMax=9L. set.seed(42) # make results reproducible outDir &lt;- paste(tempdir(),&quot;pred_output&quot;,sep=getFileSep()) # use absolute path numSplits &lt;- 2L model &lt;- suppressMessages( buildPredictor( dataList=brca, groupList=groupList, makeNetFunc=makeNets, outDir=outDir, numSplits=numSplits, featScoreMax=2L, featSelCutoff=1L, numCores=4L ) ) Let’s actually load data generated by reasonable parameters, e.g. numSplits=10L, featScoreMax=10L, featSelCutoff=9L, generated for this tutorial: outFile &lt;- sprintf(&quot;%s/CBW_Lab2_full.rda&quot;,tempdir()) download.file(&quot;https://github.com/RealPaiLab/CBW_CAN_DataIntegration_2021/raw/master/data_files/brca_pathways_full.rda&quot;, outFile) lnames &lt;- load(outFile) We can see the objects in the file using lnames(). Examine output As before, we get model results, using getResults() from our helper script, helper.R. We define sel source(&quot;helper.R&quot;) results &lt;- getResults(brca,model_full, featureSelCutoff=9L, featureSelPct=0.9) Let’s examine our confusion matrix: confusionMatrix(model_full) View top-scoring pathways with EnrichmentMap We will now visualize top-scoring pathways using EnrichmentMap. ###plotEmap(gmtFiles[[1]],nodeAttrFiles[[1]], ### groupClusters=TRUE, hideNodeLabels=TRUE) sessionInfo sessionInfo() "]]
